# 3d object detection 
- this is a different project 
- It was required to get a two newly published paper on 3d object detection
	-  understand them
	- summerize them 
	- trying to run It's code 
- you can find paper summary above , training log and results we have got 
- We have tried a lot of different papers imlpmentation but most of our effort was in 
	- [Frustum Conv Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01864.pdf)
	- [Stereo R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09738.pdf)
	- [3d complex yolo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06199.pdf)
