# Face Recognition 
- this is the implmentation of eigenfaces algorithm 
- EigenFaces Algorithm is simply using LDA or PCA for reduce dimension then applying a simple classifier
- We hace used ORL Faces Dataset 
- ORL Datasaet has 10 images paer 40 subjects. Every image is a grayscale image of size 92x112.
- there too much graphs in the notebook because It was our first time exploring the field.
- results 
- [](Face-recognition/results/k_values.jpg)
- in this graph you will find that always LDA getting a higher accuracy , and that's expected because LDA is considering the labels
