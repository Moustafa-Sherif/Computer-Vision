# Image-Segmentation

 - We have used [Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/)
 - The dataset has 500 images. The test set is 200 images. 
 - We will report our results on the first 50 images of the test set only.
 - we have considered every image pixels as features then we have used clustering algorithms
 - we have implmented k-means ,spectrul clustring algorithm
 -  for image I with M available ground-truth segmentations. For a clustering of K-clusters you will report your measures M times and the average of the M trials
 -  spectrul clustring is a very good algorithm with a completly different idea of clustring 
 - spectrul clustring maps data into graph then clustring it using normalized cut algorithm , gets great results but too much computation time.
