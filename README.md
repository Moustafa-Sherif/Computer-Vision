## Computer Vision Projects 
	in this repo you will find my computer vision projects
	I will split the projects into deep learning projects and non-deep learning projects
	

## Deep Learning Projects

	 - Image Classification
		 - Simple Project to classify image , we have implemented google net archetchre with two versions in pytorch , we aplied it to cifar dataset 
	 - MRNet
		 - Classification project On MRI Images , this is cosidered harder project because of the size of the data set , we trained Resnet Arch from Keras to detect the most common indecations for knee MRI Examination. 
	 - 3d Object Detection
		 - This was final project of computer vision course,It was required to get a paper code and make it run solve problems you faced , we have tried a lot of paper until we find one runned smoothly (one week work)
		 -  We have Summerized two papers in the pdf . 

## non-Deep Learning

	 - Image Segmentation
		 - Implmentation of K-means and K-ways normalized Cut(Spectrul clustring), applying them to an image will get you the image segmentaiton , not used a lot noawaday after availablty of deep learning model.
		 - dataset:
	 - Face Recognition 
		 - EigenFaces Algorithm ,Apply LDA,PCA to reduce dimensions then apply k-nn method to get the faces 
		 - dataset:
	 - Image Cartoonifier
		 - from normal image to cartoon image by applying simple filters .
	 - Image Stitcher :
		 - How to stitch two images ,getting the 
	 - Stereo Vision
