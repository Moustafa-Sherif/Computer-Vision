 - In this repo you will find my computer vision projects
	you will find more information and details about each project ,In the readme  of it's directory:

 - Deep Learning Projects:
	 - 	 Image Classification On Cifar:
	 - 	 MRNet training  :detect most common indecations of knee MRI Examination.
	 - 	 3d object detection :detect 3d cars using stereo images 
 - non-Deep Learning Projects
	 - Image Segmentation: using k-means and spectrual clustring to segment each image
	 - Face Recognition :eigenfaces algorithm.
	 - Image Cartoonifier:using simple filter two create cartoon from normal image.
	 - Image Stitcher :creating a panorama image from two images 
	 - Stereo Vision: getting the depth of the image from two images

## non-Deep Learning

	 - Image Segmentation
		 - Implmentation of K-means and K-ways normalized Cut(Spectrul clustring), applying them to an image will get you the image segmentaiton , not used a lot noawaday after availablty of deep learning model.
		 - dataset:
	 - Face Recognition 
		 - EigenFaces Algorithm ,Apply LDA,PCA to reduce dimensions then apply k-nn method to get the faces 
		 - dataset:
	 - Image Cartoonifier
		 - from normal image to cartoon image by applying simple filters .
	 - Image Stitcher :
		 - How to stitch two images ,getting the 
	 - Stereo Vision :
		 - Getting the depth from two images by getting the
